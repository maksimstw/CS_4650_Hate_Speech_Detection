788	The Mexico point is well taken. Tax policy is part of the solution, but arguably harder to implement (politically). Simply issuing ratcheting tariffs against major (categories of) Chinese goods would go a long way.  Partly, it depends on the end goal. I would not object to an end goal of ending virtually all trade with China; we have spent decades propping up one of our most significant geopolitical rivals. The China problem would be better addressed economically as the alternative is almost unthinkable.	0

850	You are right. But the fact that somehow the founders were these Pan-European advocates can be argued against.
