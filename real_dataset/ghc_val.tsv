Learn the truth about America’s revolutionary third constitution, founded on the Conservative Jeffersonian principles of 1781 when the U.S. itself was known as “the Confederate states of America.” Pick up a copy of our popular book: ""The Constitution of the Confederate States of America Explained: A Clause-by-Clause Study of the South’s Magna Carta,"" by award-winning historian, Southern author, & unreconstructed “Civil War” scholar, Colonel Lochlainn Seabrook.
